\item{biomarker_vars}{Vector of biomarker names.}

\item{adjustment_vars}{Vector of covariate names used for adjustment.}

\item{strat1_var}{Name of the second stratification variable.}

\item{variable_names}{Named vector with variable names. If not supplied, variable names are created by replacing in column names underscores with spaces.}

\item{caption}{Caption for the table with results.}

\item{print_pvalues}{Logical. Whether to print p-values.}

\item{print_adjpvalues}{Logical. Whether to print adjusted p-values.}
