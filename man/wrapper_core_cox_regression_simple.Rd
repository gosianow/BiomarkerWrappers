\usage{
wrapper_core_cox_regression_simple(
  data,
  tte_var,
  censor_var,
  covariate_vars,
  return_vars = NULL,
  variable_names = NULL,
  caption = NULL,
  print_nevent = FALSE,
  print_pvalues = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame.}

\item{tte_var}{Name of the time-to-event variable. This variable must be numeric.}

\item{censor_var}{Name of the censor variable. It has to be numeric and encode 1 for event and 0 for censor.}

\item{covariate_vars}{Vector with names of covariate that should be included in the formula.}

\item{return_vars}{Vector with names of covariate that for which the statistics should be returned. If NULL, sattistics for all covariates are returned.}
}
\description{
Cox regression with simple additive model.
}
\details{
If for a factor covariate that should be returned the reference level has zero count, results are set to NA becasue this levels is not used as a reference which means that it is not possible to fit a model that we want.
