\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame preprocessed for the NCC analysis with 'multipleNCC::wpl()'.}

\item{tte_var}{Name of the time-to-event variable. This variable must be numeric.}

\item{censor_var}{Name of the censor variable. It has to be numeric and encode 1 for event and 0 for censor.}

\item{covariate_vars}{Vector with names of covariates that are included in the formula of the simple additive model.}

\item{ncc_vars}{Vector of names of covariates that were measured in the NCC.}

\item{samplestat_var}{Name of variable indicating samplestat values. See 'multipleNCC::wpl()'.}

\item{m}{See 'multipleNCC::wpl()'.}

\item{match.var}{See 'multipleNCC::wpl()'. It has to be a matrix of continuous values.}

\item{match.int}{See 'multipleNCC::wpl()'.}

\item{return_vars}{Vector with names of covariates for which the statistics should be returned. If NULL, statistics are returned for all covariates.}

\item{variable_names}{Named vector with variable names. If not supplied, variable names are created by replacing in column names underscores with spaces.}

\item{caption}{Caption for the table with results.}

\item{print_pvalues}{Logical. Whether to print p-values.}

Cox regression with simple additive model for Nested Case-Control NCC study
}
\details{
If for a factor covariate that should be returned the reference level has zero count, results are set to NAs because this levels is not used as a reference which means that it is not possible to fit the model that we want.
