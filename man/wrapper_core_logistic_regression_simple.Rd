\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame.}

\item{response_var}{Name of the response variable. This variable must be a factor where 'success' is interpreted as the factor not having the first level.}

\item{covariate_vars}{Vector with names of covariate that should be included in the formula.}

\item{return_vars}{Vector with names of covariate that for which the statistics should be returned. If NULL, statistics for all covariates are returned.}

\item{strat1_var}{Name of the second stratification variable.}
}
\description{
Logistic regression with simple additive model
}
\details{
If for a factor covariate that should be returned the reference level has zero counts, results are set to NA because this levels is not used as a reference which means that it is not possible to estimate odds ratios that we want.
